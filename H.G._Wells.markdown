Wells was the author of dozens of books and short stories and is widely considered to be one of the founding authors of the science-fiction genre alongside Mary Wollstoncraft Shelley. Many of the books authored by H.G. Wells have been adapted into movies, including *The Time Machine* (1895), *The Island of Doctor Moreau* (1896), *The War of the Worlds* (1898), and many more.

His 1898 book, *The War of the Worlds*, gained fame as a radio production adaptation by Orson Welles in 1938. The radio show was so realistic that many believed the events to be actually occurring, causing widespread panic among listeners. Even though much of his writing occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Wells had an uncanny ability to predict the changing nature of technology and developments that would occur decades after his death in 1946.
